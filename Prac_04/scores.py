"""
CP1404/CP5632 Practical
Debugging exercise: almost-working version of a CSV scores file program.
The scores.csv file stores scores for each subject for 10 people.
This code reads the lines into lists, saves the first line as a list of subject codes and
converts the rest of the lines from a list of strings into a list of numbers,
which it then prints with the maximum value for that subject.
Nice. Except, itâ€™s broken! It reads the lists per user not per subject so the results are incorrect.
Use the debugger to follow what it's doing... then fix it.
